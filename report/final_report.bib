   abstract = {In this paper, we do a critical review of statistical methods for landslide susceptibility modelling and associated terrain zonations. Landslide susceptibility is the likelihood of a landslide occurring in an area depending on local terrain conditions, estimating “where” landslides are likely to occur. Since the first attempts to assess landslide susceptibility in the mid-1970s, hundreds of papers have been published using a variety of approaches and methods in different geological and climatic settings. Here, we critically review the statistically-based landslide susceptibility assessment literature by systematically searching for and then compiling an extensive database of 565 peer-review articles from 1983 to 2016. For each article in the literature database, we noted 31 categories/sub-categories of information including study region/extent, landslide type/number, inventory type and period covered, statistical model used, including variable types, model fit/prediction performance evaluation method, and strategy used to assess the model uncertainty. We present graphical visualisations and discussions of commonalities and differences found as a function of region and time, revealing a significant heterogeneity of thematic data types and scales, modelling approaches, and model evaluation criteria. We found that the range of thematic data types used for susceptibility assessment has not changed significantly with time, and that for a number of studies the geomorphological significance of the thematic data used is poorly justified. We also found that the most common statistical methods for landslide susceptibility modelling include logistic regression, neural network analysis, data-overlay, index-based and weight of evidence analyses, with an increasing preference towards machine learning methods in the recent years. Although an increasing number of studies in recent years have assessed the model performance, in terms of model fit and prediction performance, only a handful of studies have evaluated the model uncertainty. Adopting a Susceptibility Quality Level index, we found that the quality of published models has improved over the years, but top-quality assessments remain rare. We identified a clear geographical bias in susceptibility study locations, with many studies in China, India, Italy and Turkey, and only a few in Africa, South America and Oceania. Based on previous literature reviews, the analysis of the information collected in the literature database, and our own experience on the subject, we provide recommendations for the preparation, evaluation, and use of landslide susceptibility models and associated terrain zonations.},

@article{Liu2023,
   abstract = {Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) has been widely used as an important reference for development and construction planning to mitigate the potential social-eco impact caused by landslides. Originally, most of those maps were generated by the judgements of experts, which is time-consuming and laborious, and whose accuracy is difficult to be quantified because of the subjective effects. With the development of machine learning algorithms and the methods of data collection, big data and artificial intelligence have now been popularized in this field, significantly improving mapping accuracy and efficiency. Various machine learning-based methods, mainly including conventional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning have been applied and compared in LSM in different areas by previous researchers. Nevertheless, none of them can be effective in all cases. Although deep learning-based methods were proven more accurate than conventional machine learning-based methods in most data-rich situations, the latter is sometimes more popularly used in LSM, as there is not that much data in this field to train a deep learning network perfectly. In a more rigorous situation when there is very limited data, transfer learning-based approaches are applied by several researchers, which have contributed to improve the workability and the accuracy of LSM in data-limited areas. Such technical explosion has promoted the application of landslide susceptibility maps, thus contributing to mitigating the social-eco impact associated with landslides. This paper comprehensively reviews the whole process of generating landslide susceptibility maps based on machine learning methods, introduces and compares the commonly used machine learning methods, and discusses the topics for future research.},

@article{Ghorbanzadeh2022,
   abstract = {This study introduces \textit\{Landslide4Sense\}, a reference benchmark for landslide detection from remote sensing. The repository features 3,799 image patches fusing optical layers from Sentinel-2 sensors with the digital elevation model and slope layer derived from ALOS PALSAR. The added topographical information facilitates the accurate detection of landslide borders, which recent researches have shown to be challenging using optical data alone. The extensive data set supports deep learning (DL) studies in landslide detection and the development and validation of methods for the systematic update of landslide inventories. The benchmark data set has been collected at four different times and geographical locations: Iburi (September 2018), Kodagu (August 2018), Gorkha (April 2015), and Taiwan (August 2009). Each image pixel is labelled as belonging to a landslide or not, incorporating various sources and thorough manual annotation. We then evaluate the landslide detection performance of 11 state-of-the-art DL segmentation models: U-Net, ResU-Net, PSPNet, ContextNet, DeepLab-v2, DeepLab-v3+, FCN-8s, LinkNet, FRRN-A, FRRN-B, and SQNet. All models were trained from scratch on patches from one quarter of each study area and tested on independent patches from the other three quarters. Our experiments demonstrate that ResU-Net outperformed the other models for the landslide detection task. We make the multi-source landslide benchmark data (Landslide4Sense) and the tested DL models publicly available at \url\{https://www.iarai.ac.at/landslide4sense\}, establishing an important resource for remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning communities in studies of image classification in general and applications to landslide detection in particular.},

abstract = {This article introduces the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) transformation which is based on the established canonical correlations analysis. It also proposes using postprocessing of the change detected by the MAD variates using maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) analysis. The MAD and the combined MAF/MAD transformations are invariant to linear scaling. Therefore, they are insensitive, for example, to differences in gain settings in a measuring device, or to linear radiometric and atmospheric correction schemes. Other multivariate change detection schemes described are principal component type analyses of simple difference images. Case studies with AHVRR and Landsat MSS data using simple linear stretching and masking of the change images show the usefulness of the new MAD and MAF/MAD change detection schemes. Ground truth observations confirm the detected changes. A simple simulation of a no-change situation shows the accuracy of the MAD and MAF/MAD transformations compared to principal components based methods.}
